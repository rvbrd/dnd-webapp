# Dungeons and Dragons Web App

This little project is something that came to me at 2am after a regultar session of d&d with my friends.  
In the sessions there's always that moment where one person tells me they wanna use a certain spell that I've never heard of or one that I don't know exactly what it does. I always need to google it quickly and see what it does, clicking on the first website that pops up.  
What if I could have a certain website open during the session and be prepared?  
That's where this little project comes in, to fullfill my need as a Dungeon Master, and perhaps other Dungeons Masters's needs as well!
